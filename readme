Standard Meteor project called, stupidly, threejs, so:
	> meteor create threejs

1. Added a line to three.js: window.THREE = THREE;
   This yielded threeHACK.js (it ain't the exact one at three.js)
2. Placed threeHACK.js in client/lib under the Meteor project
3. Added Template.hello.rendered in the threejs.js file with the javacript code to make "calls" to three.js

NOTES

a. Meteor seems to load threeHACK.js automagically
b. Seems necessary to use the Template.hello.rendered wrapper around the javascript code that makes use of three.js "library"
